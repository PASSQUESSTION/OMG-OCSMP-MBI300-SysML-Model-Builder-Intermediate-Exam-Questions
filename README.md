<h1>SysML Model Builder Intermediate Certification</h1>

<p>The SysML Model Builder Intermediateâ€¯(prerequisite to the SysML MBA exam) certification exam tests an individual&#39;s knowledge and skills used to develop system models using the full SysML feature set enabling more detailed and precise modeling of requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints as well as those needed to define inter-relationships among model elements and diagrams, and assess aspects of model quality including conformance to language and method constraints. With a SysML Model Builder Intermediate certification, an individual is fit to be a system modeling lead on a project or a top-ranked team member (e.g., lead systems engineer) who contributes independently to the model or system.</p>

<p>1. What is an efficient way to represent highly reused patterns of interaction on sequence diagrams?<br />
A. an Interaction use referencing an interaction defined on a separate sequence diagram<br />
B. an interaction template construct that is instantiated from the referring sequence diagram<br />
C. the call interaction operator with an operand referring to the reusable Interaction defined elsewhere<br />
D. an activation on the referring sequence diagram allocated to another activation on the referenced diagram<br />
Answer: B</p>

<p>2. Which statement is true about the read only keyword when it appears next to a property?<br />
A. It states that the corresponding property is provided for reading purposes only<br />
B. It specifies that the corresponding property cannot be redefined<br />
C. It specifies that the value of the corresponding property cannot change during the lifetime of its owner.<br />
D. It specifies that the value of the corresponding property can be changed by its owner, but can only be read by other blocks<br />
Answer: A</p>

<p>3. What are the possible values of the enumeration Control Value?<br />
A. suspend and resume<br />
B. enable and disable<br />
C. suspend, resume, enable and disable<br />
D. It has no values, but is intended for a modeler to extend with their own control values.<br />
Answer: C</p>

<p>4. What is one key advantage of using SysML parametrics versus traditional derived properties?<br />
A. A derived property requires an additional constraint expression, whereas SysML parametrics does not.<br />
B. OCL-based constraint expressions can be used with SysML parametrics but not with derived properties<br />
C. it takes many more steps to specify derived properties in the typical tool compared to specifying constraint blocks.<br />
D. SysML parametrics supports non causal expressions, whereas a derived property involves an expression with a fixed output direction<br />
Answer: C</p>

<p>5. What is a best practice to define the package structure for a SysML model?<br />
A. SysML defines the package structure<br />
B. The modeling tool creates the package structure<br />
C. The modeling methodology defines the package structure.<br />

Answer: C</p>

<p>6. What are streaming parameters?<br />
A. parameters that are mapped to flow ports<br />
B. parameters in which tokens are never buffered<br />
C. parameters through which a continuous stream of tokens pass<br />
D. parameters through which an activity can accept or produce tokens throughout its execution<br />
Answer: B</p>

<p>7. How can the containment relationship be used to relate requirements?<br />
A. Packages may represent specifications, which can be contained m other specifications<br />
B. Containment allows a requirement to be decomposed by containing sub-requirements. Packages can also contain requirements<br />
C. Requirements can contain packages, which in turn can contain other requirements. This is how hierarchical specifications can be represented in SysML<br />
D. Requirements cannot use containment. They cannot contain any other model elements.<br />
Answer: B</p>

<p>8. What is the best way to specify the behavior of a functional requirement?<br />

B. Model a state machine that refines the functional requirement.<br />
